Catch2
------------------------------------------
Catch2 is a multi-paradigm test framework for C++. which also supports
Objective-C (and maybe C). It is primarily distributed as a single header file,
although certain extensions may require additional headers.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.5.4-1
  libCatch2-devel-3.8.0-1bl1
  libCatch2_3.8.0-3.8.0-1bl1
  libgcc1-12.4.0-3
  libstdc++6-12.4.0-3
  pkg-config-2.3.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.43.1-1
  cmake-3.28.3-1
  cygport-0.36.9-1
  gcc-core-12.4.0-3
  gcc-g++-12.4.0-3
  ninja-1.12.0-1

Canonical download:
  https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/archive/refs/tags/v3.8.0.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack Catch2-3.8.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./Catch2-3.8.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/Catch2-3.8.0-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/Catch2-3.8.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libCatch2_3.8.0-3.8.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libCatch2-devel-3.8.0-X.tar.xz
