MQTT-C
------------------------------------------
MQTT-C is an MQTT v3.1.1 client written in C. MQTT is a lightweight
publisher-subscriber-based messaging protocol that is commonly used in IoT and
networking applications where high-latency and low data-rate links are
expected. The purpose of MQTT-C is to provide a portable MQTT client, written
in C, for embedded systems and PC's alike. MQTT-C does this by providing a
transparent Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL) which makes porting to new
platforms easy. MQTT-C is completely thread-safe but can also run perfectly
fine on single-threaded systems making MQTT-C well-suited for embedded systems
and microcontrollers. Finally, MQTT-C is small; there are only two source files
totalling less than 2000 lines.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack MQTT-C-1.1.6-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./MQTT-C-1.1.6-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/MQTT-C-1.1.6-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/MQTT-C-1.1.6-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libmqttc1-1.1.6-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libmqttc-devel-1.1.6-X.tar.xz
