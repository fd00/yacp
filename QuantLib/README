QuantLib
------------------------------------------
The QuantLib project is aimed at providing a comprehensive software framework
for quantitative finance. QuantLib is a free/open-source library for modeling,
trading, and risk management in real-life.

Runtime requirements:
  bash-4.3.42-3
  cygwin-2.2.1-1
  libboost_test1.57-1.57.0-1
  libgcc1-4.9.3-1
  libQuantLib0-1.6.1-1bl1
  libstdc++6-4.9.3-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-13-1
  automake-9-1
  binutils-2.25-2
  cygport-0.20.2-1
  gcc-core-4.9.3-1
  gcc-g++-4.9.3-1
  libtool-2.4.6-1
  make-4.1-1

Canonical website:
  http://quantlib.org/

Canonical download:
  mirror://sourceforge/quantlib/QuantLib-1.6.1.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack QuantLib-1.6.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./QuantLib-1.6.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/QuantLib-1.6.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/QuantLib-1.6.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libQuantLib0-1.6.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libQuantLib-devel-1.6.1-X.tar.xz
