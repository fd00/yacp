actor-framework
------------------------------------------
An Open Source Implementation of the Actor Model in C++

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.6.4-1
  libcaf1.1.0-1.1.0-1bl1
  libgcc1-13.4.0-1
  libssl3-3.0.18-1
  libstdc++6-13.4.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.45-1
  cmake-3.28.3-1
  cygport-0.37.3-1
  gcc-core-13.4.0-1
  gcc-g++-13.4.0-1
  libssl-devel-3.0.18-1
  ninja-1.13.1-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack actor-framework-1.1.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./actor-framework-1.1.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/actor-framework-1.1.0-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/actor-framework-1.1.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libcaf1.1.0-1.1.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libcaf-devel-1.1.0-X.tar.xz
