armadillo
------------------------------------------
Armadillo is an open-source C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths) aiming
towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer, floating point
and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and
statistics functions.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.17-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.22.51-2
  cmake-2.8.9-2
  cygport-0.11.2-1
  gcc4-core-4.5.3-3
  gcc4-g++-4.5.3-3
  make-3.82.90-1

Canonical website:
  http://arma.sf.net/

Canonical download:
  mirror://sourceforge/arma/armadillo-3.6.1.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack armadillo-3.6.1-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./armadillo-3.6.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/armadillo-3.6.1-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/armadillo-3.6.1-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libarmadillo3-3.6.1-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libarmadillo-devel-3.6.1-X.tar.bz2
