SUMMARY="Storage conversion and expression calculator"
DESCRIPTION="bcal (Byte CALculator) is a command-line utility for storage, hardware and
firmware developers who deal with storage-specific numerical calculations,
expressions, unit conversions or address calculations frequently. If you are
one and can't calculate the hex address offset for (512 - 16) MiB immediately,
or the value when the 43rd bit of a 64-bit address is set, bcal is for you."
