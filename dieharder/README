dieharder
------------------------------------------
Dieharder is a random number generator (rng) testing suite. It is intended to
test generators, not files of possibly random numbers as the latter is a
fallacious view of what it means to be random. Is the number 7 random? If it
is generated by a random process, it might be. If it is made up to serve the
purpose of some argument (like this one) it is not. Perfect random number
generators produce "unlikely" sequences of random numbers -- at exactly the
right average rate. Testing a rng is therefore quite subtle.

dieharder is a tool designed to permit one to push a weak generator to
unambiguous failure (at the e.g. 0.0001% level), not leave one in the "limbo"
of 1% or 5% maybe-failure. It also contains many tests and is extensible so
that eventually it will contain many more tests than it already does.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack dieharder-3.31.0-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./dieharder-3.31.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/dieharder-3.31.0-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/dieharder-3.31.0-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libdieharder3-3.31.0-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/libdieharder-devel-3.31.0-X.tar.bz2
