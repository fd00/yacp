ensmallen
------------------------------------------
ensmallen provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective
function to optimize. It also provides a large set of standard and cutting-edge
optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical optimization task.
These include full-batch gradient descent techniques, small-batch techniques,
gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.

Runtime requirements:

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.43.1-1
  cmake-3.28.3-1
  cygport-0.36.9-1
  gcc-core-12.4.0-3
  gcc-g++-12.4.0-3
  libarmadillo-devel-14.2.2-1bl1

Canonical download:
  https://ensmallen.org/files/ensmallen-2.22.1.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack ensmallen-2.22.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./ensmallen-2.22.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/ensmallen-2.22.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/ensmallen-2.22.1-X.tar.xz
