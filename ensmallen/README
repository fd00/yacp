ensmallen
------------------------------------------
ensmallen provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective
function to optimize. It also provides a large set of standard and cutting-edge
optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical optimization task.
These include full-batch gradient descent techniques, small-batch techniques,
gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.

Runtime requirements:

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.29-1
  cmake-3.14.5-1
  cygport-0.33.1-1
  gcc-core-7.4.0-1
  gcc-g++-7.4.0-1
  ninja-1.9.0-1

  https://ensmallen.org/

Canonical download:
  https://ensmallen.org/files/ensmallen-2.10.3.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack ensmallen-2.10.3-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./ensmallen-2.10.3-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/ensmallen-2.10.3-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/ensmallen-2.10.3-X.tar.xz
