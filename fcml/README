Build instructions:
  1. unpack fcml-1.1.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./fcml-1.1.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/fcml-1.1.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/fcml-1.1.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libfcml0-1.1.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libfcml-devel-1.1.1-X.tar.xz
