ldesc: "Fex is a powerful field extraction tool. Fex provides a very concise
language for tokenizeing strings and extracting fields.
The basic usage model is that you provide a series of delimiter and field
selection pairs. Tokens can be any character, while field selections have a
specific syntax."
