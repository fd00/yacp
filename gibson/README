gibson
------------------------------------------
Gibson is a high efficiency, tree based memory cache server. Normal key-value
stores ( memcache, Redis, etc ) uses a hash table as their main data structure,
so every key is hashed with a specific algorithm and the resulting hash is used
to identify the given value in memory. This approach, although very fast,
doesn't allow the user to execute globbing expressions/selections on a given
(multiple) keyset, thus resulting on a pure one-by-one access paradigm. Gibson
is different, it uses a special tree based structure allowing the user to
perform operations on multiple key sets using a prefix expression achieving the
same performance grades in the worst case, even better on an average case.
Unlike many other server applications, it's not multithreaded, but it uses
multiplexing taking advantace of an event-driven network layer ( just like
Node.js, or Nginx using libevent and so on ) which provides higher performances
even on low cost hardware.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack gibson-1.2.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./gibson-1.2.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/gibson-1.2.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/gibson-1.2.1-X.tar.xz
