SUMMARY="Thin layer of graphic data types"
DESCRIPTION="When creating graphic libraries you most likely end up dealing with points and
rectangles. If you're particularly unlucky, you may end up dealing with affine
matrices and 2D transformations. If you're writing a graphic library with 3D
transformations, though, you are going to hit the jackpot: 4x4 matrices,
projections, transformations, vectors, and quaternions."
