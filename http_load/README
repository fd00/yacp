http_load
------------------------------------------
http_load runs multiple http fetches in parallel, to test the throughput of a
web server. However unlike most such test clients, it runs in a single
process, so it doesn't bog down the client machine. It can be configured to do
https fetches as well.

You give it a file containing a list of URLs that may be fetched, a flag
specifying how to start connections (either by rate or by number of simulated
users), and a flag specifying when to quit (either after a given number of
fetches or a given elapsed time). There are also optional flags for checksums,
throttling, random jitter, and progress reports.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack http_load-20140814-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./http_load-20140814-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/http_load-20140814-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/http_load-20140814-X.tar.xz
