computer.

Runtime requirements:
  bash-5.2.21-1
  cygwin-3.6.6-1
  libhttrack2-3.49.6-1bl1
  libiconv2-1.17-1
  libssl3-3.0.18-1
  zlib0-1.3.1-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-15-2
  autoconf-archive-2024.10.16-1
  automake-20250528-1
  binutils-2.45.1-1
  cygport-0.37.6-1
  gcc-core-13.4.0-1
  libiconv-devel-1.17-1
  libssl-devel-3.0.18-1
  libtool-2.5.4-1

        % cygport ./httrack-3.49.6-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/httrack-3.49.6-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/httrack-3.49.6-X.tar.xz
