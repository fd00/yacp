igraph
------------------------------------------
Igraph is a free software package for creating and manipulating undirected and
directed graphs. It includes implementations for classic graph theory problems
like minimum spanning trees and network flow, and also implements algorithms
for some recent network analysis methods, like community structure search.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack igraph-0.8.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./igraph-0.8.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/igraph-0.8.0-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/igraph-0.8.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libigraph0-0.8.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libigraph-devel-0.8.0-X.tar.xz
