ldesc: "Lib765 is the floppy controller emulation from JOYCE, separately
packaged. It is (in some sense) the reverse of LibDsk; it converts uPD765a
commands into LibDsk API calls. It should come in handy if you're writing a
PCW, CPC or Spectrum+3 emulator; if you want to use it in a PC emulator, you'll
need to add features such as DMA."
