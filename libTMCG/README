libTMCG
------------------------------------------
LibTMCG is a C++ library for creating secure and fair online card games. The
library contains a sort of useful classes, algorithms, and	high-level
protocols to support an application programmer in writing such software. The
most remarkable feature is the absence of a trusted third party (TTP), i.e.
neither a central game server nor trusted hardware components are necessary.
Thus, with the present library there is no need for an independent referee,
because the applied protocols provide a basic level of confidentiality and
fairness by itself. Consequently, the library is well-suited for peer-to-peer
(P2P) environments where no TTP is available. Of course, we cannot avoid that
malicious players share information about their private cards, but the
protocols ensure that the shuffle of the deck is performed randomly (presumed
that at least one player is honest) and thus the cards will be distributed
uniformly among the players. Further, no coalition can learn the private cards
of a player against his will (except for trivial conclusions). The
corresponding cryptographic problem, actually called Mental Poker, has been
studied since 1979 (Shamir, Rivest, and Adleman) by many authors (see the
first section of [St05] for a short survey). LibTMCG provides the first
practical implementation of such protocols.

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack libTMCG-1.3.18-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./libTMCG-1.3.18-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/libTMCG-1.3.18-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libTMCG-1.3.18-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libTMCG18-1.3.18-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libTMCG-devel-1.3.18-X.tar.xz
