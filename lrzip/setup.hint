sdesc: "Compression program optimised for large files"
ldesc: "This is a compression program optimised for large files. The larger
the file and the more memory you have, the better the compression advantage
this will provide, especially once the files are larger than 100MB. The
advantage can be chosen to be either size (much smaller than bzip2) or speed
(much faster than bzip2). Decompression is always much faster than bzip2."
