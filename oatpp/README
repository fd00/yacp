oatpp
------------------------------------------
Oat++ is a modern Web Framework for C++. It's fully loaded and contains all
necessary components for effective production level development. It's also
light and has a small memory footprint.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.5.4-1
  libgcc1-12.4.0-3
  liboatpp1-1.3.0-1bl1
  libstdc++6-12.4.0-3

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.43.1-1
  cmake-3.28.3-1
  cygport-0.36.9-1
  gcc-core-12.4.0-3
  gcc-g++-12.4.0-3
  ninja-1.12.0-1

Canonical download:
  https://github.com/oatpp/oatpp/archive/refs/tags/1.3.0.tar.gz

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack oatpp-1.3.0-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./oatpp-1.3.0-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/oatpp-1.3.0-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/oatpp-1.3.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/liboatpp1-1.3.0-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/liboatpp-devel-1.3.0-X.tar.xz
