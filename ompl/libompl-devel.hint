ldesc: "The Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) consists of many
state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planning algorithms. OMPL itself does
not contain any code related to, e.g., collision checking or visualization.
This is a deliberate design choice, so that OMPL is not tied to a particular
collision checker or visualization front end."
