SUMMARY="Smart card library and applications"
DESCRIPTION="OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its
main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate
their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and
digital signatures. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API so applications
supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it. On
the card OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with
every software/card that does so, too."
