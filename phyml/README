phyml
------------------------------------------
PhyML is a software package that uses modern statistical approaches to analyse
alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences in a phylogenetic framework.
The main tool in this package builds phylogenies under the maximum likelihood
criterion. It implements a large number of substitution models coupled to
efficient options to search the space of phylogenetic tree topologies. PhyTime
is another tool in the PhyML package that focuses on divergence date estimation
in a Bayesian setting. The main strengths of PhyTime lies in its ability to
accommodate for uncertrainty in the placement of fossil calibration and the use
of realistic models of rate variation along the tree. Finally, PhyREX fits the
spatial-Lambda-Fleming-Viot model to geo-referenced genetic data. This model is
similar to the structured coalescent but assumes that individuals are
distributed along a spatial continuum rather than discrete demes. PhyREX can be
used to estimate population densities and rates of dispersal. Its output can be
processed by treeannotator (from the BEAST package) as well as SPREAD.

Build instructions:
  1. unpack phyml-3.3.20200621-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./phyml-3.3.20200621-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/phyml-3.3.20200621-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/phyml-3.3.20200621-X.tar.xz
