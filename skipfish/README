skipfish
------------------------------------------
Skipfish is an active web application security reconnaissance tool. It
prepares an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a
recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then
annotated with the output from a number of active (but hopefully
non-disruptive) security checks. The final report generated by the tool is
meant to serve as a foundation for professional web application security
assessments.

Runtime requirements:
  bash-5.2.21-1
  cygwin-3.6.5-1
  libidn12-1.43-1
  libpcre1-8.45-1
  libssl1.0-1.0.2u+za-1
  zlib0-1.3.1-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.45.1-1
  cygport-0.37.5-1
  gcc-core-13.4.0-1
  libidn-devel-1.43-1
  libpcre-devel-8.45-1
  libssl1.0-devel-1.0.2u+za-1
  make-4.4.1-2
  zlib-devel-1.3.1-1

Build instructions:
  1. unpack skipfish-2.10b-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./skipfish-2.10b-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/skipfish-2.10b-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/skipfish-2.10b-X.tar.xz
