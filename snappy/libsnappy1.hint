sdesc: "Fast compressor/decompressor (runtime)"
ldesc: "Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression library;
instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For
instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of
magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are
anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core of a Core i7 processor in
64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at
about 500 MB/sec or more."
