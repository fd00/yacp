SUMMARY="Contract-Oriented Programming Language"
DESCRIPTION="Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for
developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart
contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network where
nobody has special authority over the execution and thus they allow to
implement tokens of value, ownership, voting and other kinds of logics."
