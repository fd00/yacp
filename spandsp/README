spandsp
------------------------------------------
Spandsp is a library of many DSP functions for telephony. These range from
simple modules, such as DTMF detection, to a complete software FAX machine.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-2.2.1-1
  cygwin-devel-2.2.1-1
  libspandsp-devel-0.0.6pre21-1bl2
  libspandsp2-0.0.6pre21-1bl2
  libtiff-devel-4.0.3-3
  libtiff6-4.0.3-3

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-13-1
  automake-9-1
  binutils-2.25-2
  cygport-0.20.2-1
  gcc-core-4.9.3-1
  gcc-g++-4.9.3-1
  libtool-2.4.6-2
  make-4.1-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack spandsp-0.0.6pre21-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./spandsp-0.0.6pre21-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/spandsp-0.0.6pre21-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/spandsp-0.0.6pre21-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libspandsp2-0.0.6pre21-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libspandsp-devel-0.0.6pre21-X.tar.xz
