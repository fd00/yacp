stdair
------------------------------------------
stdair aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, for the basis of Airline IT and travel distribution
Business Object Model (BOM), that is, to be used by several other open
source projects, such as AirRAC, RMOL, AirInv, AvlCal, AirSched, SimFQT,
SimLFS, SimCRS, TravelCCM, SEvMgr, TraDemGen, DSim, OpenTREP, etc.

Install the stdair package if you need a library of basic C++ objects
for Airline IT (e.g., schedule management, inventory, revenue management,
revenue accounting), travel distribution, demand generation and customer choice
modeling, mainly for simulation purpose.

Runtime requirements:
  bash-4.1.11-2

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  unpack stdair-1.00.1-X-src.tar.xz
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
        unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./stdair-1.00.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/stdair-1.00.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/stdair-1.00.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libstdair1.00-1.00.1-X.tar.xz
