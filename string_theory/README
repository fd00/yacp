string_theory
------------------------------------------
String Theory is a flexible modern C++ library for string manipulation and
storage. It stores data internally as UTF-8, for ease of use with existing
C/C++ APIs. It can also handle conversion to and from UTF-16, UTF-32, and
Latin-1, and has a variety of methods to simplify text manipulation.

Runtime requirements:

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.44-1
  cmake-3.28.3-1
  cygport-0.36.9-1
  gcc-core-12.4.0-3
  gcc-g++-12.4.0-3

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack string_theory-3.9-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./string_theory-3.9-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/string_theory-3.9-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/string_theory-3.9-X.tar.xz
