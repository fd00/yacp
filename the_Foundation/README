-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack the_Foundation-1.9.1-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./the_Foundation-1.9.1-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/the_Foundation-1.9.1-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/the_Foundation-1.9.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/lib_Foundation1-1.9.1-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/lib_Foundation-devel-1.9.1-X.tar.xz
