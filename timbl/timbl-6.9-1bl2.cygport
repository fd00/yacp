SUMMARY="Tilburg Memory Based Learner"
DESCRIPTION="TiMBL is an open source software package implementing several memory-based
learning algorithms, among which IB1-IG, an implementation of k-nearest
neighbor classification with feature weighting suitable for symbolic feature
spaces, and IGTree, a decision-tree approximation of IB1-IG. All implemented
algorithms have in common that they store some representation of the training
set explicitly in memory. During testing, new cases are classified by
extrapolation from the most similar stored cases."
