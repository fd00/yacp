yadm
------------------------------------------
When you live in a command line, configurations are a deeply personal thing.
They are often crafted over years of experience, battles lost, lessons
learned, advice followed, and ingenuity rewarded. When you are away from your
own configurations, you are an orphaned refugee in unfamiliar and hostile
surroundings. You feel clumsy and out of sorts. You are filled with a sense of
longing to be back in a place you know. A place you built. A place where all
the short-cuts have been worn bare by your own travels. A place you proudly
call... HOME.
